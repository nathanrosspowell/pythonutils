PythonUtils
===========

A bunch of scripts that may or may not be useful ever again

### Version

All of the Python is currently working with 

    Python 3.5

### Testing

Run the `_testing.py` file to invoke all of the *TestRun() functions.

For a file named `OutputProgress.py` the test function should be as follows:

    def outputProgressTestRun():
        print "This will be called by _testing.py"
