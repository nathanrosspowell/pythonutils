A bunch of scripts that may or may not be useful ever again

### Testing

Run the `_testing.py` file to invoke all of the *TestRun() functions.

For a file names 'OutputProgress.py' the test function should be as follows:

    def outpufProgressTestRun():
        print "This will be called be _testing.py"
